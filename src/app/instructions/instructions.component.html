	<h2>What can Python do?</h2>

				<section class="main-section" id="Install_Python">
					<header ><h1>Section </h1></header>
					<p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
					<p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line</p>
					<code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
					<p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:</p>
					<code>python --version </code>
					<p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

						<h1>Python Syntax</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important. Example:</p>
					<code>if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")</code>

  					<p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation. Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment: </p>
  					<code>#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")</code>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
					<header><h1>Python Variables</h1></header>
					<h2>Creating Variables</h2>
					<p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
					<code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code>
					<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
					<code>x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)</code>
					<p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
						<li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
						<li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
						<li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="Python_Casting">
					<header><h1>Python Casting</h1></header>
					<h2>Specify a Variable Type</h2>
					<p>There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.</p>
					<p>Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by rounding down to the previous whole number), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)</li>
						<li>float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)</li>
						<li>str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals</li>
					</ul>
